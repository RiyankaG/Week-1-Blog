I absolutely loved the concept of this painting. It was created as an antithesis of Yves Klein’s artwork through which he had nude female models rub their bodies against a canvas as “living paintbrushes.” She instead had a robot paint on the canvas as she stood nude in front of it. Her concept was to have “the female form only acknowledged in the negative space of the paintings” and remove the objectification of women through algorithm, which I thought was brilliant.

This robotic arm pushes down on the clicker and counts visitors of the artwork. I loved the concept it brought up and the questions it posed  about employment, robotics and quantification. The artwork was part of an exhibition in the Science Gallery Dublin titled Humans Need Not Apply that discussed automation in general. It also calls to question our obsessive need to quantify art and artistic expression, and I loved how it creatively did so.
